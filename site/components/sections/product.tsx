          It is built as a light alternative to a Rainmeter setup. Widgets redraw only
          when something changes, and nothing is drawn at all while Spotify is silent or
          a window covers the desktop.
        </P>
        <P>
          It is not a skin engine. There are no plugins, no scripts and no user-authored
          skins; every visual and behavioural parameter of the four widgets is a setting
          instead.
        </P>
        <P>
          There is no Spotify login and no client ID: track details and controls come
          from Windows itself, so it works on free accounts.

          Every colour setting has a picker: the last chip in its row opens a colour
          square, a hue bar and a hex field you can type into. A one-click look only

          Any text of the clock and the player can run across, down or up, with its
          letters upright or lying sideways. So the day can be a column of upright
          letters, or the title can read up the side of the album art. In the panel
          these are the <strong>Runs</strong> row (Across, Down, Up) and the{" "}
