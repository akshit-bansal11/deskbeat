        <P>
          LRCLIB knows when each line starts and nothing more, so word timing built from
          it alone is a guess: a line&apos;s time is spread over its words by length,
          and is marked as a guess. A LyricsPlus server carries the time every syllable
          is sung, and when it has the track that replaces the guess. Each word then
          fills in as it is sung and stays lit afterwards.
        </P>
        <P>
          Word timing from a server is used as it is: words can overlap, as with
          background vocals, and can leave gaps.
        </P>

        <Sub>The cache</Sub>
        <P>
          Both answers are cached on disk, in <C>%LOCALAPPDATA%\deskbeat</C>. A miss is
          remembered for a week. A server that is down is not remembered as a miss, so
          the track is asked for again next time.
        </P>

        <Sub>The servers</Sub>
        <P>
          The servers asked for word timing are <C>word_servers</C> under{" "}
          <C>[lyrics]</C>, tried in order. They are mirrors run by volunteers, and they
          come and go, which is why the list is a setting and not only a constant in the
          code. When none answers, lyrics fall back to line timing from LRCLIB.{" "}
          <C>word_sync = false</C> turns the extra lookup off.
        </P>

        <Sub>Keeping lyrics in time</Sub>
        <P>
          The media session reports a position now and then, not continuously, and the
          reports jitter. The sync clock advances on its own between reports, ignores
          jitter inside a deadband, takes the median of recent errors so one outlier
          cannot move it, eases small corrections in over a few frames, and snaps on a
          seek or a resume.

          The clock and the player have no box. Each of their elements has its own

          that window covers the work area instead and does not move, so dragging one
          element cannot disturb the others; the space between elements passes clicks
          through. The lyrics and the visualizer keep a frame, because it is what sizes
