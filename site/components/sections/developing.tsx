    <li>
      Bring your fork&apos;s <C>main</C> up to date with <C>upstream/main</C>, then
      branch from it on your fork.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep <C>crates/core</C> free of Windows types. Anything that needs a window, a
      device or Spotify goes in <C>crates/app</C>.
    </li>
    <li>
      A new setting is four things in one commit: the field with its default, its clamp
      in <C>Config::sanitized</C>, a row in the settings panel, and a test if an older
      config file has to keep loading.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add or change a test when you add logic, a branch or fix a bug. Prefer testing in{" "}
      <C>crates/core</C> over anything that needs a window.
    </li>
    <li>
      Run <C>pwsh scripts/check.ps1</C> until it is clean. Do not suppress a lint
      finding to get green.
    </li>
    <li>
      After changing a <C>Cargo.toml</C>, commit the <C>Cargo.lock</C> that <C>cargo</C>{" "}
      rewrites. The gate uses <C>--locked</C> and fails on a stale one.
    </li>
    <li>
      Commit with a Conventional Commits subject (<C>feat:</C>, <C>fix:</C>,{" "}
      <C>docs:</C>, <C>ci:</C>, with an optional scope such as <C>feat(lyrics):</C>) and
      a body that says what changed and why, including what you rejected.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a line under <strong className="text-foreground">Unreleased</strong> in{" "}
      <C>CHANGELOG.md</C>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Push the branch to your fork and open a pull request against <C>main</C>. CI runs
      the gate, builds the exe and renders the snapshots. The maintainer reviews and
      merges.
    </li>
  </>
);

const STYLE = (

    <li>
      No new dependency without a reason in the pull request. The whole workspace has
      seven.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <C>windows</C> crate stays on 0.62. Its API moves between minor versions; a
      bump is its own pull request.

    <li>Constants are named. A number that appears twice is a constant.</li>
    <li>Doc comments say why, not what the next line already says.</li>

      A widget that asks for a frame while nothing on it is moving is a bug. It is the
